Describe Use Case

See webpage:  https://www.stratoscale.com/blog/devops/practical-devops-use-case-github-jenkins-docker/

DevOps is a work practice that ties IT professionals in with software developers with the goal of streamlining infrastructure changes. This allows integration of those changes into software delivery and real time updates to product lines.  Philosophically, DevOps is a shift in the work culture to allow collaboration between development and operations. This means that no product can be considered a single tool, but rather, a collection of tools are used in various stages of the product lifecycle. 
In DevOps, there is a toolchain, which is a set of programming tools used to execute software development.  These tools are used consecutively, so that the output of one tool becomes the starting environment for the next one.
